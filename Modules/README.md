# Modules

This path stores the [`ProfileModule`](./ProfileModule/) module, which has all of my customizations and is imported by the [`_Base.ps1` profile](../Profiles/_Base.ps1), and the [`Custom` path](./Custom/), where all of my custom Powershell modules are stored.

These custom modules can be installed with the [`Install-CustomPSModules.ps1` script](../Install-CustomPSModules.ps1).
